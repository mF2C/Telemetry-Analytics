## Introduction

The main function of the Analytics module is applying machine learning and data mining algorithms to the telemetry captured and mapping it to the landscape data sources. This actuates and feeds Lifecycle Management. The results of these analytics are heuristics and models which are stored here in the Recommender module and queried for service deployment configurations.
